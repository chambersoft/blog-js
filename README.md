blog.js
=======

A blogging platform for developers who are tired of php.

```sh
npm install blog-js
```


How did I get here?
-------------------

Because WordPress is still the standard.



What is this?
-------------

A blogging platform built on node.js, browserify, AngularJS, and MongoDB with deep integration to GitHub and cloud platforms.


Who is this for?
----------------

Anyone familiar with the dev-ops lifestyle who is sick of WordPress.


But WordPress has so many templates..
-------------------------------------

So what, this is better.
